if you don't want to clear the db upon startup change  in /Backend/src/hibernate.cfg.xml
<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>  to <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">validate</property> 

if http://localhost:8080/Backend/webservices/Backend?wsdl entered in browser doesn't show a valid wsdl 
make sure no errors are within the project, not even in the client. comment out Server.java if needed.
